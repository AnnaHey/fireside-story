    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>A flash of lightning revealed a rundown shack silhouetted against the top of the hill.</p>
    <p>As the rain pelted me in the face, a strange sense of confidence overcame me and I walked towards the rundown shack.</p>
    <p>The wind blew my umbrella inside out, and I tossed it away.  Where I was going, an umbrella wasn't going to help anyway.</p>
    <p>I walked towards the big maple tree, barely seeing my way, and suddenly, I heard a strange noise, was that a frog?</p>
